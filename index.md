She is currently an Assistant Professor with the [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=1309), [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/), China. Before joining Shenzhen University, she was a Senior Researcher with [Tencent Technology Co., Ltd.](https://www.tencent.com/) from 2018 to 2021. She received her Ph.D degree in computer science from [University of Technology Sydney (UTS)](https://www.uts.edu.au/), Australia (2018), supervised by [Prof. Chengqi Zhang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Chengqi.Zhang), [A.P. Guodong Long](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Guodong.Long) and Prof. Peng Zhang, and got her master’s degree from [University of Chinese Academy of Science (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), Beijing, China, supervised by [Prof. Yingjie Tian](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~tianyingjie?language=en). During September 2017 to March 2018, She was fortunate to visit [Prof. Wei Wang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/) with Department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) at [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/).

In the past few years, she has been recognized as Overseas High-Caliber Personnel (深圳市海外高层次人才), High-level Talent in Nanshan District of Shenzhen (南山区领航人才).

Her research interests focus on **graph learning**, **natural language processing**, and **open-world machine learning**, etc. She have made contributions to advance graph machine learning methods for solving hard open-world AI problems for real-life applications, including node classification, question answering, anomaly detection, recommender systems and time series clustering. She has published more than 40 research papers in top journals and conferences, including **TPAMI, TKDE, TCYB, NeurIPS, AAAI, IJCAI, CVPR, WWW, ACM MM,** etc., and received several research funds Youth Program of National Natural Science Foundation and General Program of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province.
