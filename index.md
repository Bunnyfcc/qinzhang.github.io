# About Me
---

I am currently an Assistant Professor with the [VCC group](https://vcc.tech/index.html) at [College of Computer Science & Software Engineering](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/), Shenzhen University. I received my Ph.D. in Information and Communication Engineering from Xidian University in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Xinbo Gao](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/xbgao/). Prior to that, I received my B.E. from the School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian Univeristy in 2017. My research interest is computer vision, currently with emphasis on visual emotion analysis. I am also interested in image aesthetic analysis and image generation.
